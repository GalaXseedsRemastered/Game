    	<book1 id="1" text="Exerpted from A Space Farmer's Almanac, HX98-0071&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to advances in agriculture which predate the Slorpian Wars of the second eclipse, lifeforms across the universe can wake up in the morning and enjoy a tasty, spicy glass of mulk.  But where does this farm-fresh drink come from? From the moobus, of course! The question is often asked: how on Hooptilon Farfic does anyone get close enough to a Moobus to juice it?  The answer seems natural to any farm-raised child or biomechanically-enhanced pit fighter, but here we will endeavour to explain."/>
        <book1 id="2" text="The key to extracting a moobus's annual three-drop output of mulk is grabbing on tightly to one of its seventeen antennae and not letting go. Many a Milkulon farmhand, after deftly avoiding the moobus's mind-altering hypnotic shriek, has fallen prey to one of the false antennae sprouting from behind the animal's talon-like hooves.  The moobus uses these decoy appendages to wrap its prey in a suffocating grasp, so look out! Once you have vaulted the four sets of serrated pincers and reflected the creature's petrifying gaze with a hand mirror, you'll find yourself free to frantically twist the antennae until the precious mulk collects behind one of the Moobus's snouts.  From there, it's just a quick detoxification process to render the poisoned mulk into the spicy-fresh drink that you enjoy today!"/>
